 This is a driver for Minix version 3.1.8

 Description: 
 Device driver that will hold a secret message 
 for a specific user, and can be read only with special
 permissions. Once the device has been opened, the user
 who opened it now owns the secret. The device can be opened
 as many times as the user wants for reading, but only once
 for writing. Once it is opened for writing and reading, the
 message resets once all the read and write file descriptors 
 are closed. Driver supports service update and will preserve
 the secret data. Driver also is capable of passing permissions
 to a different user that the original owner specifies with
 a uid in the ioctl() function using the SSGRANT flag.

 The driver works as outlined in the spec, including the ioctl function to 
 transfer ownership of a secret and preservation of state under a live 
 update (ie service update /usr/sbin/secret).
